# Arduino PistolGrip Gamepad
Holds all files relating to my RC PistolGrip controller to gamepad projects where I want to make my own controller for playing Re-Volt

- This project needs XInput library and maybe a few other things i will figure out later
- Not sure if this project will make it into a YT video or not. we'll see.
- How is this not an amazon product yet?
